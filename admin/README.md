# Grocery Store Management System

This Python script provides a simple Grocery Store Management System with a graphical user interface built using Tkinter. The system allows a store manager to update inventory, generate sales graphs, add new products, and remove expired products.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PostgreSQL
- Required Python packages (install using `pip install package_name`):
  - `tkinter`
  - `psycopg2`
  - `matplotlib`

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the necessary requirements installed.
2. Update the PostgreSQL connection parameters in the `connect_to_database` method of the `GroceryStoreManager` class.
3. Run the script using `python script_name.py`.
4. The GUI will appear, providing options for inventory management.

## Features

### Update Inventory

- Allows the manager to update the details of a product in the inventory.
- Asks for the product ID and autofills existing data for easy modification.

### Generate Sales Graph

- Informs the user that sales data processing is in progress.
- Currently set to display a message indicating that sales data is being worked on.

### Add New Product

- Opens a window for the manager to add a new product to the inventory.
- Checks if the product ID already exists before adding a new product.

### Remove Expired Products

- Informs the user that the process of removing expired products is in progress.
- Currently set to display a message indicating that this functionality is under development.

## Additional Information

- The application uses Tkinter for the graphical interface.
- PostgreSQL is used as the backend database for storing inventory data.

Feel free to modify and extend the code based on your specific requirements.

**Note:** Ensure that you have a working knowledge of PostgreSQL and have set up a database with the required structure before running the script.
